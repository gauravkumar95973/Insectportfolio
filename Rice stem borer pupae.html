            <p>
                The rice stem borer pupae refer to the pupal stage of certain insect species that are pests of rice crops. One of the most common rice stem borers is the Yellow Stem Borer (Scirpophaga incertulas) and the Striped Stem Borer (Chilo suppressalis). These insects belong to the family Crambidae and can cause significant damage to rice plants by burrowing into the stems during their larval stage.
<br><br>
	Pupal Stage: After going through the larval stage, rice stem borers enter the pupal stage as part of their life cycle. The pupal stage is a transitional phase during which the larva transforms into an adult. During this stage, the insect is encased in a pupal case, which can vary in size and shape depending on the species.<br><br>
	Location: Rice stem borer pupae are typically found inside the rice plant stems. The larvae of these insects create tunnels inside the rice plant stems, and it is within these tunnels that they pupate. The pupal case provides protection for the developing insect as it undergoes metamorphosis into an adult.<br><br>
	Appearance: Rice stem borer pupae are usually cylindrical in shape and may range in color from light brown to dark brown. The pupal case is often elongated and can be distinguished from the larval stage by its lack of movement.<br><br>
	Life Cycle: The pupal stage lasts for a certain period, depending on factors like temperature and environmental conditions. After completing metamorphosis, the adult rice stem borer emerges from the pupal case and exits the rice plant stem. The adult insects then mate and lay eggs on the rice plants, starting a new generation.<br><br>
	Damage: The presence of rice stem borer larvae inside rice plant stems can weaken the plants, reduce their ability to transport nutrients and water, and ultimately lead to yield losses. Pesticides and cultural practices are often used to manage these pests and reduce the damage they cause to rice crops.<br><br>
Controlling rice stem borers is important for protecting rice yields, as these pests can have a significant economic impact on rice production. Integrated pest management strategies, which may include the use of insect-resistant rice varieties, biological control agents, and judicious pesticide application, are commonly employed to manage rice stem borer infestations.<br><br>
